        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Brian. At 34, I’m currently back in school pursuing a career in Cybersecurity.
        </p>
        <p>
            After years in a completely different industry, I decided it was time to follow a path I was actually passionate about. Transitioning careers later in life comes with its own set of challenges, but it’s also one of the most rewarding things I’ve ever done.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I’m not in class, I’m usually running home labs—building virtual environments, practicing network security, and getting my hands dirty with the tools of the trade. Since I am a hands-on learner, I believe that hands-on curiosity is the best way to learn, and I'm documenting that process here.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is to hopefully show anyone else out there who feels "stuck" in their current career that it is never too late to hit the reset button. If you’re afraid to make a move because of your age or your background, I hope my journey inspires you to take that first step. Thanks for stopping by!
        </p>
